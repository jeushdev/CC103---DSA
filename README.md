| **Practice Activity 1** | Structures | Basic creation and manipulation of structs for data management and logic. |


## 🚀 How to Run
Since `.exe` and build files are ignored in this repository (per standard `.gitignore` practices), you will need to compile the source code manually.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd repo-name/Activity_Folder
    ```
3.  **Compile and Run (g++ example):**
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o main
    ./main
    ```

## 📝 Notes
* The `.vscode` folder and binary executables (`*.exe`) are excluded from this repo to keep it clean.
* Solutions are written for educational purposes and follow the specific constraints of the course instructions.
